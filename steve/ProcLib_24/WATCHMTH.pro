// when inactive (still)+10v. when active (moving) motion is detected and ~0v 
// the unit will automatically reset to inactive after motion ceases.
// the dip switches on the rear of the unit define the reset interval.
// currently set to 1/2 sec (shortest interval availible). so motions 
// less than 1/2 second apart will not be detected as separate events.
